title: MCP Server Overview
description: "Query your CostHawk data directly from Claude Code"
---

The CostHawk MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude to query your cost data directly from the command line. No need to switch to a browser - just ask Claude about your API spending.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. CostHawk's MCP server lets Claude:

- Check your API usage and costs
- Analyze savings from flat-rate subscriptions
- Detect cost anomalies
- Manage webhooks and alerts
- Look up model pricing

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash Global Installation (Recommended)
claude mcp add -s user -e COSTHAWK_API_KEY=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE costhawk -- npx -y costhawk
```

```bash Project-Only Installation
claude mcp add -e COSTHAWK_API_KEY=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE costhawk -- npx -y costhawk
```

</CodeGroup>

After installation, restart Claude Code to load the MCP server.
