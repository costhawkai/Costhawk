## Combining Tools

You can ask complex questions that use multiple tools:

> "I'm spending more than usual this week. Can you check for anomalies and show me which project is driving the increase?"

Claude will:
1. Run anomaly detection
2. Get usage by project tag
3. Analyze and explain the results

> "Sync my Claude Code usage, then show me my total spending this month including the new data"

Claude will:
1. Sync local Claude Code data
2. Fetch updated usage summary
3. Present a comprehensive monthly report

---

<Tip>
  The MCP server returns data in markdown format by default, making it easy for Claude to present nicely formatted tables and summaries.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Privacy note:** All sync operations only send usage metadata (tokens, models, timestamps). Your code, prompts, and file paths are never transmitted.
