## Overview

Many developers use flat-rate subscriptions like Claude Max ($100/mo) or OpenAI Pro ($200/mo) without knowing if they're actually saving money.

CostHawk tracks your usage and calculates what you would have paid at retail rates, showing you the real ROI of your subscriptions.

## How It Works

1. **Track Usage** - CostHawk monitors your API calls and token usage
2. **Calculate Retail Cost** - We apply current retail pricing to your usage
3. **Compare** - See subscription cost vs retail cost
4. **Show Savings** - Instant visibility into whether you're saving money

## Savings Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Saving | Your retail cost exceeds your subscription - you're saving money |
| Below Breakeven | You're not using enough to justify the subscription cost |
| No Usage | No tracked usage for this period |

## Supported Subscriptions

## Using the MCP Server

**Check overall savings:**
> "Am I saving money with Claude Max?"

**Monthly report:**
> "Show my savings vs retail this month"

**Per-model breakdown:**
> "Break down my savings by model"

## Adding Subscriptions

Configure your subscriptions in the CostHawk dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Add your active subscriptions
3. CostHawk will automatically calculate savings

<Tip>
  For accurate savings calculations, make sure all your subscriptions are configured in the dashboard.
