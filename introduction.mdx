## What is CostHawk?

CostHawk is an AI API cost monitoring platform that helps developers and teams track their spend across multiple providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more.

Whether you're using Claude Max, OpenAI Pro, or pay-as-you-go API access, CostHawk gives you visibility into your usage and helps you understand if your flat-rate subscriptions are actually saving you money.

## Trust & Privacy

We believe transparency builds trust. CostHawk is designed so you can verify everything:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What files does CostHawk access?">
    Run `npm exec --yes costhawk@latest -- --what-we-read` to see exactly which files the MCP server accesses. We only read usage metadata from `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What data gets sent to CostHawk?">
    Only usage metadata: token counts, model names, timestamps, and hashed project IDs. Never your code, prompts, or file paths. Use `dryRun: true` to preview any payload.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disable automatic syncing?">
    Auto-sync is off by default. Enable with `COSTHAWK_AUTO_SYNC=true`. You can also disable Codex sync specifically with `COSTHAWK_CODEX_AUTO_SYNC=false`.
  </Accordion>
