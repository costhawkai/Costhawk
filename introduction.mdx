## What is CostHawk?

CostHawk is an AI cost platform for teams using OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and coding assistants.

Use it in progressive depth:

- Admin API sync for low-friction org reporting
- OTel for real-time telemetry
- Proxy + wrapped keys for hard-stop enforcement
- MCP for assistant-native workflows (fully supported)

## Quick Start

Get started in under 5 minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your path">
    Start with <a href="/integrations/admin-api">Admin API Sync</a> for quick visibility, then layer on Proxy/OTel as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable MCP for assistant workflows">
    Install CostHawk MCP so you can query usage/savings directly from your coding assistant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install MCP with Auto-Sync (optional but recommended)">
    **All platforms (recommended):**
    ```bash
    npm exec --yes costhawk@latest -- --login
    ```
    This handles browser approval + setup automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start tracking">
    Restart your MCP host, then ask: "What's my AI API usage this month?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Trust & Privacy

We believe transparency builds trust. CostHawk is designed so you can verify everything:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What files does CostHawk access?">
    Run `npm exec --yes costhawk@latest -- --what-we-read` to see exactly which files the MCP server accesses. We only read usage metadata from `~/.claude/projects` and Codex session logs (`~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.config/codex/sessions`, or `~/.local/share/codex/sessions`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What data gets sent to CostHawk?">
    Only usage metadata: token counts, model names, timestamps, and hashed project IDs. Never your code, prompts, or file paths. Use `dryRun: true` to preview any payload.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disable automatic syncing?">
    Auto-sync is off by default. Enable with `COSTHAWK_AUTO_SYNC=true`. You can also disable Codex sync specifically with `COSTHAWK_CODEX_AUTO_SYNC=false`.
  </Accordion>
