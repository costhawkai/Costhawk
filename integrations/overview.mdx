---

CostHawk supports progressive integration depth. Start simple, then add deeper controls only when needed.

## Three Integration Tiers

| Tier | Setup Time | Best For | What You Get |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Admin API Sync (Recommended start) | ~30s | Org-level visibility | Provider usage + cost data with no app code changes |
| OTel Receiver (Power users) | ~2 min | Real-time coding telemetry | Near real-time metrics/logs from instrumented clients |
| Proxy + Wrapped Keys (Advanced controls) | ~10 min | Enforcement and hard stops | Per-request tracking, attribution, and budget blocking |

## MCP Status

<Info>
  MCP remains fully supported. It is not being removed. Keep using MCP tools for assistant-native querying and local workflow automation.
</Info>

<Info>
  Wrapped keys and proxy routing also remain fully supported. This includes Google Gemini and other supported provider proxy paths.
</Info>

## How To Choose

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I want visibility fast with minimal setup">
    Start with <a href="/integrations/admin-api">Admin API Sync</a>.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I need per-request blocking or spending hard stops">
    Use proxy + wrapped keys. Start with <a href="/integrations/openai">OpenAI</a>, <a href="/integrations/anthropic">Anthropic</a>, or <a href="/integrations/google">Google</a>.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I need Google Gemini real-time tracking">
    Use <a href="/integrations/google">Google Gemini proxy</a>. Google does not expose equivalent real-time usage APIs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want assistant-native analytics inside Claude/Codex">
    Keep <a href="/mcp-server/overview">MCP</a> enabled regardless of integration tier.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recommended Rollout Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Admin API Sync">
    Connect Anthropic/OpenAI admin keys for baseline usage and cost coverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep MCP enabled">
    Use MCP tools for interactive analysis, savings checks, and alerts workflows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Proxy only where needed">
    Apply wrapped-key proxy routing to workloads that need enforcement controls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add OTel for real-time telemetry">
    Instrument advanced environments that need higher-frequency operational signals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Per-Provider Guidance

| Provider | Best Starting Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Admin API Sync | Add proxy for hard-stop enforcement and per-request control |
| OpenAI | Admin API Sync | Add proxy for strict runtime controls |
| Google Gemini | Proxy | Google lacks equivalent org usage/cost admin APIs for this use case |

## Wrapped Keys Policy

- Wrapped keys are **not** being removed.
- Existing wrapped-key users continue to work.
- New users can still choose wrapped-key onboarding when they need runtime controls.
