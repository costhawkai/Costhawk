Admin API sync is the fastest path to organization-wide cost visibility.

It gives you aggregate usage and cost data without changing your application code.

<Card title="MCP Still Supported" icon="terminal" href="/mcp-server/overview">
  MCP is not being removed. Keep using MCP tools for local workflows while Admin API sync handles org-level provider reporting.
</Card>

## When To Use This

- You want quick visibility with minimal setup
- You manage usage for a team or organization
- You do not need per-request hard-stop enforcement yet

## What You Get

- Anthropic usage buckets (`/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages`)
- Anthropic cost buckets (`/v1/organizations/cost_report`)
- Anthropic Claude Code analytics (`/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code`)
- OpenAI usage buckets (`/v1/organization/usage/completions`)
- OpenAI daily costs (`/v1/organization/costs`)

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create provider admin keys">
    Create an Anthropic Admin key (`sk-ant-admin-...`) and an OpenAI organization Admin key in each provider console.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect keys in CostHawk">
    In CostHawk, add each connection under Integrations/Connections and run a connection test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for first sync">
    Initial sync usually appears within 5 minutes. Cost endpoints are daily-granularity by provider design.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sync Cadence

- Usage endpoints: every 5 minutes
- Cost endpoints: every 5 minutes (daily buckets)
- Claude Code analytics: hourly

## Security Model

- Admin keys are encrypted at rest
- Plaintext keys are never returned after creation
- Connection list only shows fingerprint + provider org metadata
- Connection lifecycle actions are audit logged

## What Admin API Sync Does Not Replace

- **Hard spending limits / request blocking**: use proxy + wrapped keys
- **Google Gemini real-time coverage**: use proxy (Google has no equivalent usage API)
