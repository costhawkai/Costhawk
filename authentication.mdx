## Access Tokens

CostHawk uses access tokens to authenticate requests to the API and MCP server. Tokens are scoped to your account and can be created and revoked from your dashboard.

For MCP users, the recommended path is browser login:

```bash
npm exec --yes costhawk@latest -- --login
```

That flow creates a token and configures MCP automatically.

### Creating a Token

1. Go to your [CostHawk dashboard](https://costhawk.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings → Developer**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Code - Work Laptop")
5. Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again

<Info>
  Tokens are prefixed with `ch_sk_` to help you identify them in your code and configs.
</Info>

### Token Security

<Warning>
  **Never share your access tokens or commit them to version control.**
</Warning>

Best practices:
- Use environment variables to store tokens
- Create separate tokens for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Revoke tokens you no longer need

### Revoking a Token

If a token is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Go to **Settings → Developer** in your dashboard
2. Find the token in the list
3. Click the trash icon to revoke it

Revoked tokens are immediately invalidated and cannot be used for future requests.

## Using Tokens

### MCP Server

Set the `COSTHAWK_API_KEY` environment variable in your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "costhawk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "costhawk@latest"],
      "env": {
        "COSTHAWK_API_KEY": "ch_sk_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### API Requests

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://costhawk.ai/api/usage/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ch_sk_your_token_here"
```

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `401` | Missing or invalid token |
| `403` | Token doesn't have required permissions |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |

<Tip>
  If you see authentication errors, verify your token is active in the dashboard under **Settings → Developer**.
